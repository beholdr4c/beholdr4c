>>> This is my training program - sokoban, a single-player game with registration and a local leaderboard, with user data protection and login and password encryption. 

>>> The main features:
             > password complexity verification
             > hashing and encryption of the user's password and user data
             > the possibility of local competition between users

!!! To successfully compile the game, you need to install additional libraries such as <openssl/sha.h> and <GL/glut.h> if you don't have them yet.
